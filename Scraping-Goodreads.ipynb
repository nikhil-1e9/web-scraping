This is the path I took to finding my purpose but also my voice in a world that didnât always see me.\\\\n\\\\nAs I wrote Finding Me, my eyes were open to the truth of how our stories are often not given close examination. We are forced to reinvent them to fit into a crazy, competitive, judgmental world. So I wrote this for anyone running through life untethered, desperate and clawing their way through murky memories, trying to get to some form of self-love. For anyone who needs reminding that a life worth living can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.\\\\n\\\\nFinding Me is a deep reflection, a promise, and a love letter of sorts to self. My hope is that my story will inspire you to light up your own life with creative expression and rediscover who you were before the world put a label on you.'},\n",

Four years after Elissaâs death, Alyssa died, then Alissa at twenty-six. \\\\n \\\\nIn The Elissas, Samantha endeavors to understand why they ultimately met a shared, tragic fate that she was spared, in turn, offering a chilling account of the secret lives of young suburban women.'},\n",

       "  'Description': \"What happens when we canât joke about some of the most important stuff in life? In a 2019 study, 40% of people reported censoring themselves out of fear that voicing their views would alienate them from the people they care about most. Those people should probably not read this book in public. In You Canât Joke About That, Kat Timpf shows why much of the way we talk about sensitive subjects is wrong. Weâve created all the wrong rules. We push ourselves into unnecessary conflicts when we should feel like weâre all in this together. When someone says âyou canât joke about that,â what they really mean is âthis is a subject that makes people sad or angry.â Hilariously and movingly, Timpf argues that those subjects are actually the most important to joke about. She shows us we can find healing through humor regarding things you probably don\\\\'t want to bring up in polite conversation, like traumatic break-ups, cancer, being broke, Dave Chappelle, rape jokes, aging, ostomy bags, religion, body image, dead moms, religion, the lab leak theory, transgender swimmers, gushing wounds, campus censorship, and bad Christmas presents. \\xa0 This book is Kat Timpf with her hair down, except since hers is mostly extensions, this book is Kat Timpf with her hair out. Read it because you want to get to know her better. Read it because itâs the best book on free speech and comedy in a generation. Read it because you want to laugh out loudâ¦ even at the kind of stuff weâre afraid to say out loud. Just read it, and youâll be glad you did.\"},\n",

Les Moonves, the popular CEO of CBS, felt particularly threatened and schemed with his allies on the board to strip Shari of power.

During World War II, the German army used the towering Colditz Castle to hold the most defiant Allied prisoners. For four years, these prisoners of the castle tested its walls and its guards with ingenious escape attempts that would become legend.\\\\n\\\\nBut as Macintyre shows, the story of Colditz was about much more than escape. Its population represented a society in miniature, full of heroes and traitors, class conflicts and secret alliances, and the full range of human joy and despair. In Macintyreâs telling, Colditzâs most famous namesâlike the indomitable Pat Reidâshare glory with lesser known but equally remarkable characters like Indian doctor Birendranath Mazumdar whose ill treatment, hunger strike, and eventual escape read like fiction; Florimond Duke, Americaâs oldest paratrooper and least successful secret agent; and Christopher Clayton Hutton, the brilliant inventor employed by British intelligence to manufacture covert escape aids for POWs.\\\\n\\\\nPrisoners of the Castle traces the warâs arc from within Colditzâs stone walls, where the stakes rose as Hitlerâs war machine faltered and the men feared that liberation would not come soon enough to spare them a grisly fate at the hands of the Nazis.

Growing up the eldest daughter in a large, highly controlled, fundamentalist Christian household, Jessica Willis was groomed to perform, and to conform to her father\\\\'s disturbing and chaotic teachings. Cut off from anything unapproved by her father, Jessica was persistently curious about the outside world, always wondering what was normal or potentially dangerous about her upbringing. When the Willis family rocketed into fame after their appearances on multiple televised talent competitions in 2014, Jessica and her family landed their own reality TV show and toured across the globe, singing and dancing for millions.

She said she feared for his safety, that police tend to think of little Black boys as older and less innocent than they really are.Through evocative illustrations and sharp humor, Bell examines how The Talk shaped intimate and public moments from childhood to adulthood. While coming of age in Los Angelesâand finding a voice through cartooningâBell becomes painfully aware of being regarded as dangerous by white teachers, neighbors, and police officers and thus of his mortality. Drawing attention to the brutal murders of African Americans and showcasing revealing insights and cartoons along the way, he brings us up to the moment of reckoning when people took to the streets protesting the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. And now Bell must decide whether he and his own six-year-old son are ready to have The Talk.'},\n",

After years of bitter combatâStallone once threw a bowl of flowers at Schwarzeneggerâs head, and the body count in Schwarzeneggerâs Commando was increased so the film would âhave a bigger dick than Rambo ââthe worldâs biggest action stars have at last made peace.\\\\n\\\\nIn this wildly entertaining account of the golden age of the action movie, Nick de Semlyen charts Stallone and Schwarzeneggerâs carnage-packed journey from enmity to friendship against the backdrop of Reaganâs America and the Cold War.

When Jurassic Park trounced Schwarzeneggerâs Last Action Hero in 1993, the glory days of these macho menâand the vision of masculinity they celebratedâwere officially over.\\\\n\\\\nDrawing on candid interviews with the action stars themselves, plus their collaborators, friends, and foes, The Last Action Heroes is a no-holds-barred account of a period in Hollywood history when there were no limits to the heights of fame these men achieved, or to the mayhem they wrought, on-screen and off.'},\n",

The greatest movie star of the past 75 years covers everything: his traumatic childhood, his career, his drinking, his thoughts on Marlon Brando, James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, John Huston, his greatest roles, acting, his intimate life with Joanne Woodward, his innermost fears and passions and joys. With thoughts/comments throughout from Joanne Woodward, George Roy Hill, Tom Cruise, Elia Kazan and many others.\\\\n\\\\nA TIME BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR \\\\n\\\\n&quot;Newman at his best...with his self-aware persona, storied marriage and generous charitable activities...this rich book somehow imbues his characters\\\\' pain and joy with fresh technicolor.&quot; --The Wall Street Journal\\\\n\\\\nIn 1986, Paul Newman and his closest friend, screenwriter Stewart Stern, began an extraordinary project. Stuart was to compile an oral history, to have Newman\\\\'s family and friends and those who worked closely with him, talk about the actor\\\\'s life. And then Newman would work with Stewart and give his side of the story. The only stipulation was that anyone who spoke on the record had to be completely honest. That same stipulation applied to Newman himself. The project lasted five years.\\\\n\\\\nThe result is an extraordinary memoir, culled from thousands of pages of transcripts. The book is insightful, revealing, surprising. Newman\\\\'s voice is powerful, sometimes funny, sometimes painful, always meeting that high standard of searing honesty. The additional voices--from childhood friends and Navy buddies, from family members and film and theater collaborators such as Tom Cruise, George Roy Hill, Martin Ritt, and John Huston--that run throughout add richness and color and context to the story Newman is telling.\\\\n\\\\nNewman\\\\'s often traumatic childhood is brilliantly detailed. He talks about his teenage insecurities, his early failures with women, his rise to stardom, his early rivals (Marlon Brando and James Dean), his first marriage, his drinking, his philanthropy, the death of his son Scott, his strong desire for his daughters to know and understand the truth about their father. Perhaps the most moving material in the book centers around his relationship with Joanne Woodward--their love for each other, his dependence on her, the way she shaped him intellectually, emotionally and sexually.\\\\n\\\\nThe Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man is revelatory and introspective, personal and analytical, loving and tender in some places, always complex and profound.\"},\n",

We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptuneâs Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.\\\\n\\\\nA Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspectiveâthe story of one manâs bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage.

Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.\\\\n\\\\nThis beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obamaâs conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.'},\n",

Independence Day weekend, 1960: a young cop is murdered, shocking his close-knit community in Stamford, Connecticut. The killer remains at large, his identity still unknown. But on a beach not far away, a young Army doctor, on vacation from his post at a research lab in a maximum-security prison, faces a chilling realization. He knows who the shooter is. In fact, the manâa prisoner out on paroleâhad called him only days before. By helping his former charge and trainee, the doctor, a believer in second chances, may have inadvertently helped set the murder into motion. And with that one phone call, may have sealed a policemanâs fate. Alvin Tarlov, David Troy, and Joseph DeSalvo were all born of the Great Depression, all with grandparents whoâd left different homelands for the same American Dream. How did one become a doctor, one a cop, and one a convict? In Genealogy of a Murder , journalist Lisa Belkin traces the paths of each of these three menâone of them her stepfather. Her canvas is large, spanning the first half of the 20th immigration, the struggles of the working class, prison reform, medical experiments, politics and war, the nature/nurture debate, epigenetics, the infamous Leopold and Loeb case, and the history of motorcycle racing. It is also a look into the workings of the mind and heart. Following these threads to their tragic outcome in July 1960, and beyond, Belkin examines the coincidences and choices that led to one fateful night. The result is a brilliantly researched, narratively ingenious story, which illuminates how we shape history even as we are shaped by it. 8 pages of illustrations'},\n",

Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientistsâwhose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward.\\\\n \\\\nDuring more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every AmericanâDemocrat or Republicanâwho cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our childrenâs health.\\\\n \\\\nThe Real Anthony Fauci reveals how âAmericaâs Doctorâ launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies.\\\\n \\\\nIn early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gatesâ \\\\$147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable \\\\$60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy.\\\\n \\\\nThe Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.'},\n",

His heart was always for the people of Florida, one of the most diverse and culturally rich states in the union. Since becoming governor of the Sunshine State, he has foughtâand wonâbattle after battle, defeating not just opposition from the political left, but a barrage of hostile media coverage proclaiming the end of the world. When he implemented COVID-19 policies based on evidence and focused on freedoms, the press launched a smear campaign against him, yet Floridaâs economy thrived, its education system outperformed the nation, and Floridaâs COVID mortality rate for seniors was lower than that in thirty-eight states. When he enacted policies to keep leftist political concepts like critical race theory and woke gender ideology out of Floridaâs classrooms, the media demagogued his actions, but parents across Florida rallied to his cause. Dishonest attacks from the media donât deter him. In fact, DeSantis keeps racking up wins for Floridians. In 2022, the governor delivered a historic, record-setting victory, winning by nearly 20 points and more than 1.5 million votes.

For writer and comedian Blythe Roberson, there are only so many Mary Oliver poems you can read about being free, and only so many times you can listen to Joni Mitchellâs travel album Hejira, before you too, are itching to take off. Canonical American travel writers have long celebrated the road trip as the epitome of freedom. But why does it seem like all those canonical travel narratives are written by white men who have no problems, who only decide to go the desert to see what having problems feels like? To fill in the literary gaps and quench her own sense of adventure, Roberson quits her day job and sets off on a Great American Road Trip to visit Americaâs national parks. America the Beautiful? is a hilarious trip into the mind of one of the Millennial generationâs funniest writers. Borrowing her Midwestern stepfatherâs Prius, she heads west to the Loop of mega-popular parks, over to the ocean and down the Pacific Coast Highway, and, in a feat of spectacularly bad timing, through the southwestern desert in the middle of July. Along the way she meets new friends on their own personal quests, learns to cope with abstinence while missing the comforts of home, and comes to understand the limitsâand possibilitiesâof going to nature to prove to yourself and your Instagram followers that you are, in fact, free. The result is a laugh-out-loud-while-occasionally-raging-inside travelogue, filled with meditations and many, many jokes on ecotourism, conservation, freedom, traffic, climate change, and the structural and financial inequalities that limit so many Americansâ movement. Ultimately, Roberson ponders the Is quitting society and going on the road about enlightenment and libertyâor is it just selfish escapism?\"},\n",

Se la memoria Ã¨ una sabotatrice sopraffina e la scrittura, come il ricordo, rischia di falsare allegramente la tua identitÃ , allora il comico Ã¨ una precisa scelta letteraria, il grimaldello per aprire allâindicibile. In questa storia allâapparenza intima, câÃ¨ il racconto precisissimo di certi cortocircuiti emotivi, di quellâenergia paralizzante che puÃ² essere la famiglia, dellâimpresa sempre incerta che Ã¨ il diventare donna. Con una prosa nervosa, pungente, dallâintelligenza sempre inquieta, Veronica Raimo ci regala un monologo ustionante.'},\n",

Valentine Low asks the important questions: who really runs the show and, as Charles III begins his reign, what will happen next?\\\\n\\\\nThroughout history, the British monarchy has relied on its courtiers - the trusted advisers in the King or Queen\\\\'s inner circle - to ensure its survival as a family, an ancient institution, and a pillar of the constitution. Today, as ever, a vast team of people hidden from view steers the royal family\\\\'s path between public duty and private life. Queen Elizabeth II, after a remarkable 70 years of service, saw the final seasons of her reign without her husband Philip to guide her. Meanwhile, newly ascended Charles seeks to define what his future as King, and that of his court, will be.\\\\n\\\\nThe question of who is entrusted to guide the royals has never been more vital, and yet the task those courtiers face has never been more challenging. With a cloud hanging over Prince Andrew as well as Harry and Meghan\\\\'s departure from royal life, the complex relationship between modern courtiers and royal principals has been exposed to global scrutiny. As the new Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate - equipped with a very 21st century approach to press and public relations - now hold the responsibility of making an ancient institution relevant for the decades to come.\\\\n\\\\nCourtiers reveals an ever-changing system of complex characters, shifting values and ideas over what the future of the institution should be.

An hour later, a mountain of rubble containing waste from a coal mine collapsed above the village of Aberfan, swamping buildings and killing 144 people, many of them children. Among the doctors and emergency workers who arrived on the scene was John Barker, a psychiatrist from Shelton Hospital, in Shrewsbury. At Aberfan, Barker became convinced there had been supernatural warning signs of the disaster, and decided to establish a âpremonitions bureau,â in conjunction with the Evening Standard newspaper, to collect dreams and forebodings from the public, in the hope of preventing future calamities.\\\\n\\\\nMiddleton was one of hundreds of seemingly normal people, who would contribute their visions to Barkerâs research in the years to come, some of them unnervingly accurate. As Barkerâs work plunged him deeper into the occult, his reputation suffered. But in the face of professional humiliation, Barker only became more determined, ultimately realizing with terrible certainty that catastrophe had been prophesied in his own life.\\\\n\\\\nIn Sam Knightâs crystalline telling, this astonishing true story comes to encompass the secrets of the world.

Then Christianâa young college student and retail worker who canât seem to get an accurate diagnosis, let alone treatment, for his debilitating knee pain. Geronimo, thirty-six years old, has liver failure, but his meager disability check disqualifies him for Medicaidâand puts a life-saving transplant just out of reach. Roxana, whoâs lived in the community without a visa for more than two decades, suffers from complications related to her cancer treatment. And finally, thereâs Ebonie, a young mother whose high-risk pregnancy endangers her life. Whether due to immigration status, income, or the vagaries of state Medicaid law, all five are denied access to care. For all five, this exclusion could prove life-threatening.\\\\n\\\\nEach patient eventually lands at Ben Taub, the county hospital where Dr. Nuila has worked for over a decade.

       "\"This beautifully written book is about a mother and her daughter at a crucial point in both of their lives. It's a story of coping with grief and learning how to go on with life and how to rely on other people to help you through difficult times in life.Dani is an artist and has just learned that due to an eye disease, she'll be losing her vision in the future. Her life is in turmoil, her ex-husband (but still good friend) has just died in a car accident and she's working to help her daughter Bella cope with life without her dad in it. Dani decides to move from their home in the Outer Banks of NC to an inland farm near the Virginia border and she's taking Bella away from the only home that she's ever known. Bella feels betrayed - not only does she have to learn to navigate life without her father but she's left behind all of her friends and the comfort of a home she loved. Most of the time, instead of lashing out at her mother, she stuffs her feelings inside and works to present a calm personality. But at 12, she does have bouts of anger and resentment and her mother is her favorite target. She's very resentful that her mother has signed her up for a 2 week grief camp for children who have lost someone close because she doesn't want to share her closely held feelings.Dani has always kept her true feelings from the world around her - ever since her mother died when she was very young. She is extremely worried about losing her sight but doesn't share it with her daughter or her new boyfriend. She absolutely doesn't want anyone to feel sorry for her and wants to continue her life as a gallery owner.Grief is difficult to navigate and affects everyone differently but it's absolutely crucial to have people to depend on. Will Bella learn to depend on her mother over the loss of her father and will Dani ever be able to tell Bella about her eye issues that will cause her to lose her sight? Will they both realize that together they can face whatever life brings their way?This book is beautifully written and well written characters. Dani was a great example of a mother trying cope with changes in her life and Bella was a perfect example of a pre-teen girl who can go from happy to angry very quickly. These are two characters and a splendid story that I won't soon forget.\""

      " Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.\n",
